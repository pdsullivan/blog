I have been playing with some development using the [Ionic Framework][ionic] the past few weeks and recently I got to the point on an app where I wanted to get it deployed to my device to get some native testing done. I got it deployed but was upset when I opened the app and saw it was scaled up to the iphone 6 plus.
