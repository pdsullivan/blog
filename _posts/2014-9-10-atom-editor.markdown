Why not, I am now using a new text editor. It is called [Atom][atomio] and it is cool.

Built by [GitHub][githublink], Atom is very customizable text editor with themes and packages you can add as needed. Atom has a layout that is similar to SublimeText. Out of the box it is fully functional as a solid text editor, which is great if you have ever had to go find packages for other text editors that most of which can’t be installed with out adding the package that installs the packages…it gets a little complicated.

I got into the beta program for Atom and have been using it since then on my Macbook Air. It has really grown into my goto app if I need to type anything.

In the past I have used Notepad++ on windows machines and SublimeText (2&3) on all sorts of machines along with some others sprinkled in here and there. Those ecosystems are a little muddied with old packages and stale designs. There are for sure some things that those text editors can do and thats to be expected, I still have sublime text installed and use it for a few little things.

The UI theme I am using in the shot below is “Trendy Light” which is a flat light UI theme I downloaded.
